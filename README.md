This is my entry to a Data Science competition on Kaggle.com where the sale price of the houses are predicted.

Round 1 : An algorithm is developed that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. A model is built to improve the Zestimate residual error. 
Round 2: A home valuation algorithm is built from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that increase the accuracy fo the prediction.
