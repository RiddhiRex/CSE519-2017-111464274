This is my entry to a Data Science competition on Kaggle.com where the sale price of the houses are predicted.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1 

Round 1 : An algorithm is developed that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. A model is built to improve the Zestimate residual error. 
Round 2: A home valuation algorithm is built from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that increase the accuracy fo the prediction.

It was done as part of Data Science Fundamentals course in Fall 2017.
